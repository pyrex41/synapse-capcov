"""Export a retained SCIP index as claim facts + evidence (section 29).

SCIP is a *producer of static observations*, never an oracle. This module turns
one retained index -- ``runner.read_scip_index(path, retain=True)`` or
``runner.normalize_scip_json(raw, retain=True)`` -- plus the tree-sitter side's
raw discover dict into a validated claims ``Bundle`` whose every fact carries
the same ``index`` digest context, whose every fact has an ``Evidence`` record
with a content-derived id and an explicit ``depends_on`` chain, and whose
completeness witnesses are emitted only when their audited emission conditions
hold. The bundle's ``digest()`` is a pure function of the inputs: permuting the
documents, occurrences or symbols of the index changes nothing.

IDENTITY
--------
``index`` is a content digest of the normalized relations the exporter emits,
not of the index file: scip-go writes per-document ``symbols`` in Go map order,
so two indexings of one tree produce different ``index.scip`` bytes, and a
digest of those bytes is not reproducible (section 28). The recipe
(``INDEX_IDENTITY = "static-relations-v1"``) is

    index = sha256("static-relations-v1:" + canonical_json({
        "relations": sorted(<every relation name the bundle declares>),
        "rows": {relation: sorted(canonical rows with the ``index`` column
                                  removed) for every exported primitive
                 relation with at least one row, except the compatibility
                 relations (``index_describes_run``, ``scip_index_comparable``)}}))

Compatibility relations bind the index to *other* contexts (a run, another
index) and are supplied by the consumer at claim time, so they are keyed by the
identity rather than part of it: declaring that an index describes ``run-1``
does not make it a different index.

Every fact is first built under a placeholder index, the identity is computed
from the finished rows, then every ``index`` column is set to it and the
evidence ids (which embed ``index[:12]`` and the row digest) are computed --
content digest, then index, then ids. Two exports of the same normalized
content therefore carry the same ``index``, the same evidence ids and the same
``bundle_digest`` whatever the indexer's emission order and whichever copy of
the tree was indexed. The digest of the index file the caller read
(``sha256(index.scip bytes)``, kind ``binary``, or ``sha256("scip-json:" +
canonical_json(raw))`` for a checked-in fixture, kind ``json``) is a *run
receipt*: it is reported in ``ExportResult.messages`` and carried in bundle
metadata as ``index_file_digest`` / ``index_file_digest_kind``, and
``bundle_digest`` excludes those keys (``RECEIPT_METADATA_KEYS``, with ``out_of_tree_documents``) so the
receipt never becomes identity. ``scip_index.digest_kind`` carries the literal
``"static-relations-v1"``. The tree-sitter side is bound to the same ``index``
through ``scip_index_tree``: the exporter hashes the language-scoped source
tree (``artifacts.patterns_for(language)``) and, when ``ast_raw`` carries the
``tree_digest`` it was computed over, refuses to export (``status = "stale"``)
unless the two agree.

LINE FRAME
----------
Every ``line`` / ``start_line`` / ``end_line`` column in the bundle is 1-based
-- the frame the tree-sitter side, ``resolve.scip_defs_by_location`` and every
human-facing capcov line use. SCIP delivers 0-based lines and the runner passes
them through unmodified; the exporter lifts them here, once, so
``route_handler_location(IX,S,F,L)`` joins ``scip_definition_site(IX,F,L,Sym)``
and ``static_op_site`` joins ``static_site_owner`` without a per-rule shift.
Recorded in bundle metadata as ``line_frame``.

EVIDENCE
--------
Ids are ``scip:<index12>:<relation>:<row12>`` for SCIP-derived relations
(``scip_*``) and ``static:<index12>:<relation>:<row12>`` for the tree-sitter and
identity side, ``row12 = sha256(canonical_json([relation, row]))[:12]``.
``Evidence.source`` is the producer string: the indexer (``scip-go 0.2.7``) for
what the indexer said, ``treesitter-routes <lang>`` for the tree-sitter side,
``capcov.claims.static.scip_facts v1`` for exporter-computed rows, and
``capcov.claims.static.scip_facts <predicate>-v1`` for each completeness
witness, naming the predicate whose conditions were checked. Raw occurrences
are never exported in the slice profile; a row derived from one depends on
``external:scip-occurrence:<index12>:<occ12>`` where ``occ12`` is the prefix of
the occurrence's content digest (path, symbol, range, roles) -- the same digest
carried in full in the ``occurrence`` column of reference relations.

AST_RAW CONTRACT
----------------
``ast_raw`` is the deep tree-sitter adapter's dict (``deep_core.build_deep_dict``
optionally folded by ``resolve.hybrid_raw``). The keys read, all optional:
``surfaces`` (``{id, handler, handler_symbol, file, line}``), ``_node_locations``
(``{node: [file, line]}``), ``excluded_surfaces`` (``{"surfaces": [...]}`` or a
list of ``{method, path, reason}``), ``entities`` (``{name, file, line, table?}``),
``op_sites`` (``{file, line, entity, crud}`` -- the recognizer's output; the deep
dict itself keeps only the node-keyed ``_ops`` projection, so a caller wanting
``static_op_site`` rows passes the sites through), ``blind_spots``
(``{file, line, kind, reason}``), ``scip_residue`` (``resolve._residue``'s
``{file, line, callee, kind?}``), ``call_sites`` (``{file, line, callee}``, used
for ``static_site_owner`` only in the full profile), ``unresolved``
(``{kind, node?/handler?/id?, source{file,line}?}``) and ``tree_digest``. The
call-site census counts as *available* only when both ``scip_residue`` and
``blind_spots`` are present; without it no ``scip_references_closed`` witness
is emitted, because "no residue" cannot be asserted about a census nobody took.
