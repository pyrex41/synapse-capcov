"""Export an observation receipt directory as claim facts + evidence (Lane A, judge side).

A check harness is a *producer of runtime observations*, never an oracle.  This
module turns one receipt directory -- written by a check that put one
pre-registered scenario set to an incumbent implementation and a candidate
implementation under one nonce, one fixture and one comparison policy -- into a
validated claims ``Bundle`` whose every fact carries the receipt's ``run``
context (or the ``policy`` / ``scenario_set`` context for the relations scoped
to those), whose every fact has an ``Evidence`` record with a content-derived
id, an explicit ``depends_on`` chain and a ``source`` naming the *producer
class* the row is attributed to, and whose completeness witnesses are emitted
only where the receipt's ``completeness`` block says the corresponding table is
closed.  The bundle's identity is a pure function of the exported rows.

It mirrors ``capcov.claims.replay.replay_facts`` deliberately -- same
``ExportResult``, same ``_Facts`` accumulator, same identity/receipt separation
-- so a reader of one can read the other.

NO MODEL.  Neither the schema nor this exporter knows what a model is.  There
is no model column, no model producer class and no way to ingest one, so the
claim built on these rows is model-free *by construction*.  What that costs is
stated, not hidden: ``model_conformance`` is a mandatory ``unassessed`` row and
a positive, closed premise of the claim, so the claim does not derive at all
unless the receipt states in exported rows that it assessed no model.

RECEIPT DIRECTORY CONTRACT
--------------------------
``<root>/.work/observation/<check>/`` holds ``receipt.json`` and required
``log.txt``, plus a receipt-local ``observation_admissions.json`` only for
fixture tests. Production calls
must pass admissions as an external file with an independently captured digest;
the receipt-local copy is available only with the explicit fixture-test option.
``receipt.json`` is ONE canonical JSON document (sorted keys, UTF-8) with the
blocks of ``REQUIRED_BLOCKS``; ``repeat`` is the only optional block.  Every
digest is lowercase 64-hex sha256 and ``run.id`` is its first 16 hex.

Why one document and not a directory of ``<relation>.json`` files as the replay
receipt uses: 49 heterogeneous checks cannot each hand-write 17 relation files
without the emitter becoming the only real author anyway, and one document
keeps a single place where a lie must be told -- which this exporter can then
cross-check against itself.  ``results`` and ``agreement`` are the harness's own
summary and are RECOMPUTED here from ``observations``; a receipt whose summary
disagrees with its own rows is refused (R-4, R-10).  The directory envelope is
kept so ``log.txt``'s bytes can be hashed and verified.

``observation_admissions.json`` is the reviewer's ledger, the same file shape
and staleness binding ``model_scope_exclusions.json`` has for the replay pack::

    {"producer": "reviewer <name>",      # optional; first token must be reviewer
     "reviewer": "<name>", "reviewed_at": "<date>",
     "reviewed_against": {"policy": "<digest>", "scenario_set": "<digest>",
                          "check": "<check id>"},
     "rows": [{"relation": "policy_admitted", "version": "<v>"},
              {"relation": "scenario_set_admitted", "version": "<v>"},
              {"relation": "masked_difference_admitted",
               "normalization": "<id>", "field_path": "<path>"}, ...]}

Every row may carry ONE optional extra key, ``note``: free text for a human
reviewer.  It is validated as a non-empty string and then DROPPED.  No rule
reads it, no relation carries it, it reaches no ``Evidence.source`` and no
bundle metadata, so two ledgers that differ only in their notes export the same
bundle with the same ``observation_digest``.  It is the ledger's ONLY tolerance:
every other unknown key is still refused (R-2).  Nothing a reviewer writes there
can widen a mask, admit a difference or change a verdict -- a note that needed
to be read would have to become a relation of its own first.

``reviewed_against`` that does not match the receipt's digests is ``stale``:
the review is real, it is simply not a review of this policy or this set.  A
missing ledger is not a refusal -- it is an absent premise, and the judge then
withholds the claim rather than inferring an admission.

NON-WAIVABLE REFUSALS
---------------------
``REFUSALS`` names them.  Every refusal message begins with its rule id
(``"R-7: ..."``), which is the stable part of the contract: the prose after the
id names the offending row.  All of R-1..R-15 are ``invalid-input`` -- a
contract finding the caller reports, never something to work around.  They are
where the *facet gaps* are stopped: an observation with no status, a digest
that does not recompute, a normalization that changed a value without being
declared.  Datalog cannot see a field that was never written down, so nothing
downstream tries to.

R-EFF is a NAMED RESIDUAL, not a solved problem: effect closure is asserted
with no independent list to check it against.  This exporter's only defence is
recomputing ``effects_digest`` from the ``effects`` rows (R-3), which catches
inconsistency, never under-observation.  The per-effect rows themselves are
receipt evidence for that digest and are NOT exported as relations: the digest
is the unit ``effects_disagree`` compares, no rule read a row, and the schema
declares no relation for one (its original ``observation_effect`` /
``observation_effect_rows_closed`` were removed as coverage-shaped dead
weight; the receipt's ``effects`` rows and ``by_side.<side>.effect_rows`` box
are unchanged on the wire).

R-9 has a ONE-SIDED form (``_read_firings``): a normalization that fired on one
side only, where the two sides' raw digests for that facet differ and their
normalized digests match, has erased a real wire difference and must be
exported as a ``masked_differences`` row -- which the judge then refuses to
negate over without a reviewer admission -- exactly as a two-sided mask must.
The judge carries its own copy of that rule over ``observation_body_raw``
(``body_masked`` / ``observation_mask_undisclosed``), so an erased body
difference blocks the claim even if a row reached the bundle without this
refusal.

IDENTITY
--------
The bundle's identity (metadata ``observation_digest``, kind
``OBSERVATION_IDENTITY = "observation-relations-v1"``) is a content digest of
the normalized relations the exporter emits, never of the files' bytes::

    observation_digest = sha256("observation-relations-v1:" + canonical_json({
        "relations": sorted(<every relation name the bundle declares>),
        "rows": {relation: sorted(canonical rows) for every exported relation
                 with at least one row}}))

Facts are assembled under a placeholder identity, the identity is computed from
the finished rows, then the evidence ids (which embed
``observation_digest[:12]`` and the row digest) are computed -- content digest,
then ids.  ``reproduce``, the receipt directory and the log's path are *run
receipts*: carried in bundle metadata under ``RECEIPT_METADATA_KEYS`` and
excluded from ``bundle_digest``, so where and when the check ran never becomes
identity.

EVIDENCE
--------
Ids are ``<prefix>:<observation12>:<relation>:<row12>`` where ``prefix`` is the
evidence-id prefix of the relation's producer class (``EVIDENCE_PREFIXES``:
``observe`` for the check harness, ``reviewer`` for the reviewer).  There are
only those two classes anywhere in the pack -- no ``shen``, ``modelcheck``,
``mut``, ``php-census``, ``replay``, ``php`` or ``go`` -- so a model row cannot
be ingested at all, and a file that claims one of those classes is refused at
ingestion (``evidence-producer``), which is the single boundary at which
producer authority is enforced.  ``Evidence.source``'s first whitespace token
is the producer class; the default is ``"<class> capcov.claims.observation.observation_facts v1"``
and a completeness witness carries the predicate whose emission condition was
checked.  Every row depends on the ``observation_run`` row and on
``external:source:<source_digest>``, ``external:fixture:<fixture>``,
``external:policy:<policy>`` and ``external:scenario-set:<scenario_set>``; a
stability row also depends on ``external:run:<run_a>`` / ``<run_b>``, the two
repeat runs, which are outside this receipt.
