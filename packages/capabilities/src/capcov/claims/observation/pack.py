"""Load the reviewed observation rule pack (``rules-observation-v1.json``) as a validated Bundle.

The pack **ships as package data** beside this module -- exactly as
``schema_observation_v1.json`` does -- and is read through
``importlib.resources``, so ``capcov.claims.observation.join`` builds the
judge's combined bundle from an installed wheel with no source tree on disk.

Unlike ``capcov.claims.replay.pack`` there is **no reviewed original
elsewhere**: v1 ships no ``experiments/claim-semantics/observation/`` mirror,
because no corpus adapter reads observation receipts yet and a mirror nobody
reads is only a second opinion waiting to drift.  The file beside this module
is the reviewed file.

The pack is kept in raw IR JSON wire form and merged verbatim: every relation
declaration and rule comes from the file, nothing is evaluated here.
