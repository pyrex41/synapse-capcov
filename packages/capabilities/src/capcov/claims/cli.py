"""Experimental CLI for the claim-semantics workbench (EXPERIMENT-PLAN section 18).

Reached only through the ``experiment`` namespace of ``capcov``::

    capcov experiment claims shen authority (--bundle B.json | --rules PACK.json)
    capcov experiment claims shen evaluate --bundle B.json --relation R --row '[...]'
    capcov experiment claims shen why-not  --bundle B.json --relation R --row '[...]'

Every command prints one JSON document on stdout.  Exit status: 0 when the
authority verdict is ok / the row is derivable / a why-not report was
produced; 1 when the authority verdict is not ok or the row is not
derivable (a semantic answer, not an error); 3 for a named operational
failure of the Shen runtime (``ShenUnavailable`` / ``ShenFailure``), whose
JSON carries ``operational_failure``; 2 for usage errors.

Stage D's model checker (``claims/modelcheck.py``) is reached the same way::

    capcov experiment claims modelcheck --model DIR [--out DIR] [--timeout S] [--keep]

It typechecks the Shen domain model under ``DIR`` (``DIR/shen/load.shen``) and
prints the certificate; with ``--out`` it writes ``modelcheck-certificate.json``,
the transcript and, for a well-formed model only, ``model_well_formed.json``
(the receipt file the replay exporter reads).  Exit 0 well-formed, 1 ill-formed
(the failing judgements are in the JSON), 3 for a checker or runtime failure.

The static producer profile (``claims/static/scip_facts.py`` plus
``claims/static/closure.py``) is reached the same way::

    capcov experiment claims static --static scip --target TREE [--language go]
        [--ast-raw AST.json] [--scope all|package:PREFIX|documents:A,B] [--out BUNDLE.json]

It indexes the tree with the SCIP toolchain, exports the static facts exactly as
the exporter always has, and ADDITIONALLY emits the resolver's enumerated
residue as ``static_unresolved_call_site`` rows plus, for each scope whose
residue is empty, the ``call_graph_closed`` witness a negative static claim needs
(``rules-static-closure-v1``).  Exit 0 with a bundle, 2 for a usage refusal, 3
for a named operational failure -- an absent SCIP toolchain reported in
``capcov discover --resolver scip``'s own words among them.

The advisory profile is reached the same way and is the one profile nothing may
depend on::

    capcov experiment claims jev [ARGS...]

``jev`` is the Jev pattern reviewer: it talks to a network service with
``$JEV_API_KEY`` and returns patterns a reader weighs.  No claim, premise or
verdict is derived from it, which is what *advisory* means here -- a checkout
without the module, without the key or without the network judges exactly the
same.  Its module (``claims/jev.py``) is imported inside this branch only, so
naming any other command never loads it, and when it is not part of the
checkout the command answers with a named ``profile-unavailable`` refusal
(exit 3) rather than an ImportError.

The assumption registry (``claims/assumptions.py``) is reached the same way::

    capcov experiment claims assumptions registry   --receipt DIR [--out DIR]
    capcov experiment claims assumptions invalidate --receipt DIR --drop ID [--drop ID]

``--evaluator`` chooses the kernels both commands judge with: ``python``
(the default, standard library only), ``souffle``, ``souffle-compiled``, a
comma list of them, or ``all`` for every one whose tool is present.  Naming one
that is not here is a refusal (exit 2) that names the tool and how to install
it; the default needs nothing, so a bare invocation judges in any checkout.

``registry`` judges a replay receipt with the target-go join and prints the A2
registry document; ``invalidate`` additionally withdraws each ``--drop``
assumption (an ``asm:`` id or the evidence id of an assumption row -- either
way every record attesting that assumption is withdrawn), prints one A3
document per drop and, with ``--out``, writes ``assumptions.json`` and
``invalidation-<id12>.json`` beside the join's ``receipt.json``.  Exit 0 when
the documents were produced, 2 for a refusal (the exporter refused the receipt,
an unknown id, or a withdrawal that would refute a claim), 3 when the two
kernels disagree on the withdrawn bundle (the replay path is printed).

Two shapes a consumer has to know, stated here because they are the contract:

* stdout is a **wrapper**, not a bare document: ``{"registry": <A2>}`` for
  ``registry`` and ``{"registry": <A2>, "invalidations": [<A3>, ...]}`` for
  ``invalidate``.  ``--out DIR`` writes the bare documents as files.
* ``--receipt`` is optional and **defaults to the committed fixture receipt**
  (``CAPCOV_REPLAY_RECEIPT_DIR`` overrides it).  A bare invocation therefore
  judges the fixture rather than refusing; pass ``--receipt`` to judge a run.

Both assumption commands need the target-go join (``tests/claim_semantics``),
which carries the experiment's fixtures and is not part of the installed
package.  ``_join_module`` finds it on ``sys.path`` when the checkout's
``tests`` package is importable and otherwise beside this package, and refuses
with exit 2 -- never a traceback -- when neither is there.  The refusals that
say nothing about the join are answered *before* it is reached, so a bad
``--receipt`` is named as a bad ``--receipt`` wherever the command runs.

``--out`` is a **directory** for these two commands (the join's artifacts),
unlike the ``shen`` commands where it is a file, so a refusal or a kernel
mismatch is printed on stdout only and never written into it.
