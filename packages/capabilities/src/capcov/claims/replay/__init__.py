"""Replay (runtime) claim inputs: the frozen primitive replay schema and its exporter.

``schema_replay_v1.json`` is the frozen declaration set for the replay judge
(Phase 4) -- every primitive replay relation the harness, the two systems under
test, the model runner and the mutation tool report, the ``run`` / ``model``
context columns, the completeness witnesses and the two compatibility
relations that bind a model to a run and a static index to a replay.  It is
loaded here, never edited here: a change to it is a schema version, not a
patch.  The per-relation field set is exactly that of
``capcov.claims.static.schema_static_v1.json``.

``replay_facts`` turns one receipt directory written by the replay harness
into a validated claims ``Bundle`` of facts and evidence keyed by the receipt's
``run``, whose identity is a digest of the exported relations and never of the
files' bytes.
