"""Export a replay receipt directory as claim facts + evidence (Phase 4, judge side).

The replay harness is a *producer of runtime observations*, never an oracle.
This module turns one receipt directory -- written by the Go replay driver
after replaying a recorded request set against the PHP system, the Go system
and the Shen model, under one nonce and one snapshot -- into a validated claims
``Bundle`` whose every fact carries the receipt's ``run`` context (or the
``model`` context for model-scoped relations), whose every fact has an
``Evidence`` record with a content-derived id, an explicit ``depends_on`` chain
and a ``source`` naming the *producer class* the row is attributed to, and
whose completeness witnesses are emitted only when the receipt says the
corresponding table is closed.  The bundle's ``digest()`` is a pure function of
the receipt's content: permuting the rows of any file changes nothing.

It mirrors ``capcov.claims.static.scip_facts`` deliberately -- same
``ExportResult``, same ``_Facts`` accumulator, same identity/receipt
separation -- so a reader of one can read the other.

RECEIPT DIRECTORY CONTRACT
--------------------------
This is the contract the Go replay driver writes.  ``receipt.json``::

    {"version": 1,
     "run": "<run id>",                      # symbol; the bundle's run context
     "nonce": "<sha256>", "snapshot": "<sha256>", "model": "<sha256>",
     "php_commit": "<git sha>", "go_commit": "<git sha>",
     "closed": {"replay_requests": true, "php_effects": true, "go_effects": true,
                "php_post_states": true, "go_post_states": true,
                "model_admissible": true, "mutant_kills": true},
     "model_writes_closed": [{"model": "<sha256>", "op": "<op>"}, ...],
     "mutants_closed":      [{"model": "<sha256>", "op": "<op>"}, ...],
     "receipts": {...}}                      # wall clock, paths, container ids

plus one JSON file per observation relation, named ``<relation>.json``::

    {"rows": [{"<column>": <value>, ...}, ...],
     "producer": "<class> <detail>"}         # optional, see EVIDENCE

for each of ``replay_request``, ``php_post_state``, ``go_post_state``,
``php_effect``, ``go_effect``, ``model_effect``, ``model_admissible``,
``model_writes``, ``mutant`` and ``mutant_killed`` (``OBSERVATION_FILES``).
Row objects carry the relation's columns by name; a ``run`` column may be
omitted (it is the receipt's ``run``) and a ``model`` column may be omitted (it
is the receipt's ``model``).  A row naming *another* run is a leftover of a
different replay and makes the export ``stale``; a row naming another model,
an unknown column, a missing column or a value of the wrong type is
``invalid-input``.  A missing ``<relation>.json`` means zero rows -- and the
corresponding ``*_closed`` witness is still emitted only if ``closed`` says so,
because "no rows" and "no rows exist" are different statements.  Every key of
``closed`` defaults to ``false``; ``model_writes_closed`` / ``mutants_closed``
default to empty.  ``replay_run`` has no file: its one row is the receipt
header.

One observation per write and per post-state (``UNIQUE_KEYS``): two
``php_effect`` / ``go_effect`` / ``model_effect`` rows sharing
``(run, [model,] req, table, kind, pk)`` with different ``cols_digest``, or
two ``php_post_state`` / ``go_post_state`` rows for one ``(run, req)`` with
different ``state_digest``, are contradictory reports of the same event and
make the export ``invalid-input`` naming the key -- the judge never carries
both as facts and lets a rule pick.  A row repeated verbatim is one fact.
``model_admissible`` is a set of admissible states per request and is not
constrained.

``closed.php_post_states`` / ``closed.go_post_states`` (witnesses
``php_post_states_closed`` / ``go_post_states_closed``) say that every replayed
request's post-state on that side was reported.  Without them a request whose
post-state the runner omitted is invisible to the disagreement check while
the disagreement closure still holds, so the judge treats an unwitnessed
post-state table as open: no ``*_disagreement_closed`` row, no
qualification.

IDENTITY
--------
The bundle's identity (metadata ``replay_digest``, kind
``REPLAY_IDENTITY = "replay-relations-v1"``) is a content digest of the
normalized relations the exporter emits, never of the files' bytes::

    replay_digest = sha256("replay-relations-v1:" + canonical_json({
        "relations": sorted(<every relation name the bundle declares>),
        "rows": {relation: sorted(canonical rows) for every exported primitive
                 relation with at least one row, except the compatibility
                 relations (``model_describes_run``, ``index_describes_replay``)}}))

Unlike the static exporter's ``index``, the ``run`` context is *not* derived
from the identity: it is the receipt's run id, content the harness reported,
and it takes part in the identity like every other column.  Compatibility
relations bind the run to *other* contexts (a model, a static index) and are
keyed by the identity rather than part of it: declaring that index ``i``
describes the replay does not make it a different replay.

Every fact is first built under a placeholder identity, the identity is
computed from the finished rows, then the evidence ids (which embed
``replay_digest[:12]`` and the row digest) are computed -- content digest, then
ids.  The ``receipts`` object of ``receipt.json`` (wall-clock timestamps, file
paths, container ids) and the directory the receipt was read from are *run
receipts*: carried in bundle metadata under ``RECEIPT_METADATA_KEYS`` and
excluded from ``bundle_digest``, so a receipt never becomes identity.

EVIDENCE
--------
Ids are ``<prefix>:<replay12>:<relation>:<row12>`` where ``prefix`` is the
evidence-id prefix of the relation's producer class (``EVIDENCE_PREFIXES``:
``replay``, ``php``, ``go``, ``shen``, ``mut``, ``reviewer``; the ``php-census``
class shares the ``php`` prefix).  Every relation of the frozen schema is
owned: the harness (``replay``) owns the request, effect, post-state and kill
closures, the model runner (``shen``) owns ``model_admissible_closed``,
``model_writes_closed`` and ``model_describes_run``, the mutation tool
(``mut``) owns ``mutants_closed`` and the reviewer owns
``index_describes_replay`` -- so a runner cannot emit another producer's
closure and the validator refuses one that tries (``evidence-producer``).
A relation that declared no class would use the ``replay`` prefix.  ``row12 =
sha256(canonical_json([relation, row]))[:12]``.

``Evidence.source`` is the producer string and its first whitespace-delimited
token is the *producer class* that ``claims.validation`` checks against the
relation's declared ``producer_classes`` (issue ``evidence-producer``).  The
default source for an observation row is ``"<class> capcov.claims.replay.replay_facts v1"``
(the class the schema attributes the relation to, then the transcriber); a
``<relation>.json`` may name its real producer in ``producer`` (for example
``"php fg-cloud 1a2b3c"``) and that string is carried verbatim -- so a file
that claims a producer class the relation does not admit is rejected at
ingestion, which is the single boundary at which producer authority is
enforced.  Completeness witnesses use
``"<class> capcov.claims.replay.replay_facts <predicate>-v1"`` -- the producer
class the schema attributes the closure to (``witness_source``), then the
transcriber, then the predicate whose emission condition was checked; a
witness the schema leaves unowned carries no class token, and compatibility
rows use ``default_source`` like any other owned row.  Rows depend on the ``replay_run`` row,
on the ``replay_request`` row of their request when one is exported, and on
``external:model:<model>``, ``external:git-commit:<commit>``,
``external:snapshot:<snapshot>`` and ``external:index:<index>`` for the
identities the receipt only names.
