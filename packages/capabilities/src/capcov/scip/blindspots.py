"""Enumerate the blind spots no static resolver can see through, and diff the
AST's call sites against what SCIP managed to resolve.

This is the half SCIP cannot do. A `getattr(obj, name)`, an `eval`, a computed
`__import__` -- these have no static target for ANY resolver, SCIP included,
because the target is a value built at runtime, not a source token. capcov's
contract is that such a site is NAMED, not silently dropped: a resolver that
loses an edge reports fewer capabilities and looks identical to one that found
them all. So the hybrid keeps two things SCIP does not give you.

* ``enumerate_blind_spots`` lists every dynamic-access site (getattr / setattr /
  eval / exec / dynamic import / namespace reflection) with a file and a line.
  These are unresolvable by construction -- the enumerable-unresolved floor that
  is true no matter how good the resolver is.

* ``blind_spot_residue`` takes the call sites the AST pass SAW and the sites SCIP
  reported resolving, and returns the difference. SCIP never tells you what it
  failed to resolve; this recovers that set from the black box by subtraction --
  everything enumerated, minus everything resolved -- and marks each remainder
  unresolved rather than dropping it.

The enumerator is per language. ``enumerate_call_sites``/``enumerate_blind_spots``
take a ``language`` (defaulting to ``"python"`` so the resolver integrates with no
ordering dependency): Python is a pure ``ast`` census + the dynamic-access builtin
inventory; Go and PHP are a tree-sitter census + that language's
reflection/dynamic-dispatch inventory (Go ``reflect`` and interface dispatch; PHP
variable-variables, dynamic method names, and facade ``__call``/``__callStatic``
magic -- the known no-larastan scip-php blind spot). A resolver that returned an
empty census for Go/PHP would look byte-identical to a clean run, so a language
with no strategy raises rather than returning ``[]``; that is the soundiness floor
the hybrid exists to hold.

The Python path is pure stdlib and always importable. The tree-sitter half is
imported lazily, only when a Go/PHP enumeration is actually requested (exactly as
``flows/discovery.py`` does), so ``blindspots`` stays dependency-free for the
Python resolver and for ``capcov gate``, and ``blind_spot_residue`` -- the
subtraction -- is language-agnostic and testable with a resolver's output fed in
by hand, no indexer installed.
