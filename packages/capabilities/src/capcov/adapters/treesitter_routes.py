"""treesitter-routes as a CORE adapter: routes in any tree-sitter language.

This is a thin wrapper. The discovery engine lives in `flows.discovery`
(`_discover_from_config`) and stays the shared implementation the flows CLI also
uses; here it is fed a config assembled from a `[[adapters]]` entry in
capcov.toml and its obligation inventory is projected onto the CORE adapter
contract by `adapters.build_core_dict`.

The route opinion -- WHICH calls are routes -- is the config-supplied tree-sitter
query, so one adapter serves Go, JavaScript, Python and the rest. A `methods`
allowlist drops off-verb candidates into `excluded_surfaces` (visible, not
silent); a non-literal path becomes a `dynamic-route` under `unresolved`; the
named limits of static route reading become `boundary` entries under
`unresolved`. Branch/exception candidates the engine also finds are behavioural
obligations for the `outcomes` lane and are not projected here.

Needs the optional `treesitter` extra (tree-sitter + tree-sitter-language-pack),
imported lazily by the engine, so `import capcov.adapters.treesitter_routes`
stays stdlib-only.
