# Bounded qualification measurements

`scripts/measure_qualification.py` runs a local JSON manifest one sample at a
time under the package's machine-wide heavy lock. It accepts at most eight
samples and 900 seconds of declared command time. The default lock timeout is
zero, so a live producer keeps the lock; an unacquired sample is recorded as
blocked and later samples do not start.

The report records source commit and dirty-diff identity, input/output tree
hashes, native-cache snapshots, lock wait, child execution time, exit status,
and cold/warm output identity comparisons. It never records command argv,
environment values, host paths, or raw inputs. The JSON report and capped
stdout/stderr tails are private files (directories mode `0700`, files mode
`0600`); each tail is limited to 16 KiB and common credential forms are
redacted.

The manifest schema is `capcov-qualification-measurement-v1`. Each sample
names a safe `id` and `phase`, `source_root`, `command` as an argv array, and
optional `input_root`, `output_root`, `cache_dir`, `env`, `timeout_seconds`,
and `toolchain` pins. Cold and warm samples that share
`comparison_group` have their output tree hashes compared. A `cold` sample must
start with an empty cache directory; a `warm` sample must start with a
nonempty one.

For a Bifrost shake sample, set `require_go_target: true` and provide
`shake_case`. The command must pass `--shake --json --only <case> --impls
shen-go`; the tool accepts the sample only when that exact case reports the
`shen-go` implementation as `PASS` and the detail confirms one target ran.
This rejects Bifrost's zero-target `PASS` and every skipped Go target.

The measurement plan for a qualification checkpoint is five samples: the
existing observation judge, one Stage D modelcheck invocation, one export,
and a cold then warm rejudge of that same export. Toolchain pins belong in the
manifest as revisions or binary digests. A native worker is not proposed from
these results; matching identities and at least a 2x warm end-to-end gain
would only justify a later review of that option.
