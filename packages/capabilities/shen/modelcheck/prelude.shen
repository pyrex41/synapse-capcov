\* shen/modelcheck/prelude.shen -- Stage D: reify a Shen domain model for typing.

   Loaded UNTYPED (tc -) before the model.  Nothing here judges anything; it
   only (1) loads the model silently, recording every file it loaded, (2)
   computes the model's own answers to a fixed set of questions -- declared
   write-sets, the tables its effects touch on witness states, its admissible
   sets under every outcome, its atlas rows, its registry entries -- and (3)
   writes each answer as a Shen LITERAL into a generated unit file whose only
   form is a typed judgement.  The unit is then loaded under (tc +), where the
   datatypes in types/*.shen decide whether the literal inhabits the
   well-formedness type.  A type error there is a well-formedness failure of
   the model, trapped and reported as `MC FAIL <id> <message>`.

   Two facts about Shen's type checker shape everything below (measured on
   shen-go c12933d and shen-cl, plan section 18, 2026-09-16):

   * A datatype side condition sees the SYNTACTIC term being typed, so a list
     literal arrives as [cons X [cons Y []]] and must be walked (tt.value)
     before a predicate can look at it.  Side conditions on the head of a
     (cons X Xs) pattern see the literal atom directly.
   * A load unit that defines more than one function, or a bare define with
     no other form, is declared twice ("changing the type of F") and its
     judgement stops gating.  Every types/*.shen file therefore holds ONE
     datatype, or ONE define followed by a marker form, and every generated
     unit holds exactly one judgement form.

   Every predicate used by a datatype must be total: the checker tries the
   rule against unrelated terms while searching. *\
