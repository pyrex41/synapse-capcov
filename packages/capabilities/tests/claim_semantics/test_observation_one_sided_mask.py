"""The reproduced false green: a normalization that fires on ONE side and erases a real difference.

Before this round both the producer and this exporter skipped any firing key
with fewer than two sides (``if len(sides) < 2``).  So a receipt in which the
candidate answered with a body the incumbent did not, and a ``drop`` /
``preserves: none`` normalization fired on the candidate ALONE and made the two
normalized bodies equal, exported ``complete`` with no ``masked_differences``
row, and the judge derived ``observations_agree`` -- supported, complete,
"agreeing" -- with nothing for a reviewer to admit and nothing in the summary
saying a difference had been erased.

The variant below is built from the committed agreeing receipt with exactly
that edit and nothing else: the candidate's ``tenant-own`` raw body digest
differs from the incumbent's, a one-sided ``drop-audit`` firing takes it back
to the incumbent's digest, the policy declaring that normalization is admitted
by the reviewer, and ``masked_differences`` is left empty.  Under the old
rule ``OneSidedMaskTest`` fails on its first assertion with ``'complete' !=
'invalid-input'``; under the new rule (R-9, one-sided form) the receipt is
refused, the judge builds no bundle, and the summary carries the refusal.

``DisclosedOneSidedMaskTest`` is the positive half: the same receipt WITH the
masked-difference row exports, is blocked on ``observation_masked_unadmitted``
until a reviewer admits the mask, and derives agreement once one does -- the
control is a gate, not a wall, exactly as for a two-sided mask.

``RawBodyRuleTest`` is the judge's own copy of the rule: ``observation_body_raw``
is read by ``body_masked`` / ``observation_mask_undisclosed``, so a row set in
which the raw bodies differ, the normalized bodies match and no masked row
discloses it does not derive agreement even if it somehow reaches the bundle
without passing through the exporter.
