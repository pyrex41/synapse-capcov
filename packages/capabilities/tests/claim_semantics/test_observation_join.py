"""Judging the four committed receipts, and the cases that must NOT derive agreement.

Every verdict here is read off the closure of the combined bundle -- the
observation pack plus the exported receipt plus the reviewer's three claim-time
rows -- and never off the receipt's own ``results`` or ``agreement`` block.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT EXERCISED.  Soufflé is not required to be installed, so the
verdicts below come from the pure-Python kernel and the certificates from
``static.certificate.certify``, which is engine-independent and re-checked with
``recheck``.  The two-kernel differential (``join.evaluate_join``) is the spec's
own bar for calling any of this verified, and it is SKIPPED where ``souffle`` is
not on PATH -- a skip, never a pass.  ``KernelDifferentialTest`` is that test.
