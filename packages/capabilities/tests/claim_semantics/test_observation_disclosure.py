"""What the judge's report must carry however the run went (C6, C7).

Two defects are pinned here, both of the same shape: something the receipt
DISCLOSED existed only in an input nobody printed.

C6.  ``model_conformance`` -- the admission that no model of intended behaviour
described the run, without which "the two sides agreed" is easily read as "the
candidate is correct" -- is an ``unassessed`` row of every receipt.  It reached
the judge's summary only from the CLOSURE, so in the only configuration
available without Soufflé on PATH (``build`` with no differential run) the
summary printed ``unassessed: []``.  The exporter's own messages -- every open
completeness box with its reason, the absent admissions ledger, the absent log
-- never reached the summary at all.  Now both always do, and the summary says
which of the closure and the receipt the rows came from.

C7.  ``configuration.sides_distinct: false`` was one more message in that
unprinted list: a receipt that never claimed two distinct processes exported
clean and derived agreement.  It is now a refusal (R-15), and the refusal
arrives in the judge's report rather than in a list the reader never sees --
``test_observation_facts_export`` pins the refusal itself, this file pins that
it survives into the report.

The two-kernel differential is not run here (it needs Soufflé and is skipped in
``test_observation_join.KernelDifferentialTest``).  ``_PythonOnly`` stands in for
its result so ``summary`` has a closure to read; nothing here claims the kernels
agree.
