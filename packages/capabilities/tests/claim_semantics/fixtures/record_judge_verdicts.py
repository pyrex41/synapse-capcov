"""Record ``expected_judge_verdicts.json`` from a THREE-KERNEL run of the judge.

The table beside this script is what ``tests/claim_semantics/test_evaluator_selection.py``
holds the python-only judge to: verdicts, exit codes, per-op qualifications,
missing premises and certificate digests, for every committed receipt fixture.
It is only worth comparing against if all three kernels produced it, so this
script refuses to write one unless ``--evaluator all`` really resolved to
``python, souffle, souffle-compiled`` -- i.e. it must be run inside the pinned
devShell::

    nix develop ../.. --command \\
        python3 tests/claim_semantics/fixtures/record_judge_verdicts.py

Nothing volatile is recorded: no timings, no paths, no compiled-binary
provenance, no kernel digests -- only the judgement, which is a property of the
receipt and the rules and must be identical whichever kernels ran.
