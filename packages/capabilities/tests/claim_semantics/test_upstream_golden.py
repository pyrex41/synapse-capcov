"""With no flag and no optional tool, this branch reproduces upstream main byte for byte.

`fixtures/upstream_golden/` was produced by upstream main (commit 1b6a47a) from
a separate read-only checkout, with the optional toolchain hidden from PATH and
no extras installed -- see its README.md.  This test replays the same
`generate.py` against THIS tree, through the same `normalize.py`, and requires
the result to be identical.  It is the assertion the whole optional-profiles
direction rests on: every addition is reachable only through an explicit flag or
a capcov.toml key, so the default path is not ours to move.

What is compared: `discover` on the go fixture (which needs an extra it does not
have, and says so), the full `discover -> observe -> reconcile -> gate -> report`
pipeline on the python fixture, `discover` on an OpenAPI document, `flows
coverage`/`gate`, `features validate`, and every `--help`.  Artifacts, stdout,
and exit codes, all byte-identical after the golden's own `<root>`/timestamp
normalization.

Two documented exceptions, each with its own test rather than a silent skip:

* **The last line of a failing run, not its traceback.**  `normalize.py` writes
  a `.error_line` beside every non-empty `.stderr` precisely because the frames
  above it carry `cli.py` line numbers that move with any edit.  The `.stderr`
  files that have an `.error_line` are compared through it; the rest are
  compared whole.
The class states its two preconditions rather than assuming them: the golden was
recorded on host CPython 3.13 with no extras installed, and on any other
interpreter it skips with a message naming what it found and where to re-run it
(the devShell's python312 wraps argparse's subcommand list differently, which
would read as "our branch moved upstream's default path" when it is nothing of
the kind).  Two tests outside the class keep those constants tied to the
fixture's own README, so a skip can never quietly become permanent.

* **`reconcile --help` and `gate --help` list the new opt-in flags.**  A flag
  that exists appears in its command's help -- upstream's own
  `discover --help` lists `--resolver` for exactly this reason.
  `test_reconcile_and_gate_help_gains_only_the_judge_flags` pins the delta to
  exactly `--judge`, `--receipt`, `--judge-out`, `--evaluator`, `--model`: no
  upstream option lost, no sixth option gained.
